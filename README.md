# FinTech Project 3 
# Digital Art

This application offers digital art creators a one-step full solution from minting and registering their digital art to putting the art pieces on the auction.</br>
The simple user friendly interface of the applcation allows a user to first mint and register his/her art piece. Once the NFT is minted and registered, we utilize Pinata services to store the newly created contracts in a decentralized manner. </br>
After minting and registering their art, the creator can right away put it on the decentralized marketplace. The auction runs for a certain time period within which the bidders can place their bids and, where the highest bid and the highest bidder are identified after each bid. The bid withdrawl is also available to the bidders who are not identified as the highest bidder. The withdrawl is open during as well as some additional time after the auction's closing.</br>
Once the auction has ended, the NFT will have changed the ownership and be transferred to the highest bidder, if any, while the highest bid will have been transferred to the seller.

   - [Streamlit-lottie](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-lottie/) - to read more about deploying, installing and customizing.<br/>

4. `dotenv` Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables. 

   - [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - to read about available functions and installation.<br/>

5. `web3` is a Python library for interacting with Ethereum

    - [web3](https://pypi.org/project/web3/) - to read about available functions and installation.<br/>
    
6. `attributedict` is library that allows you to access dictionary keys as if they were object attributes. 

   -[attributedict](https://pypi.org/project/attributedict/) - to read about available functions and installation.<br/>

7. `requests` with the requests library, you can easily send HTTP requests to web servers and APIs. 

   - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - to read about available functions and installation.<br/>

8. `JSON` the json library is used to encode and decode data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. 

   - [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - to read about available functions and installation.<br/>

9. `math` library provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

### Software Installation
Once all the libraries are installed please Install following software:

#### Ganache
Ganache is a program that allows you to set up a local blockchain, which you can be used to test and develop smart contracts.
1. Eownload the latest version of Ganache and then create a Ganache workspace throught this link [Ganache download page](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
2. Once installed please open Ganache and create a workspace by clicking Quickstart Ethereum. 
![Ganache_Quickstart](Images/Ganache_quickstart.jpg)
3. Open Sample.env file in the cloned folder and use the RPC SERVER address from Ganache as input for the WEB3_PROVIDER_URI address in the Sample.env file and save Sample.env file. 

### Web Services

#### Remix IDE
Remix IDE is used to build and test smart contracts created in Solidity. For this project the web version of Remix IDE can be used
1. Open Remix IDE by clicking the following link [REMIX IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Select solidity in the featured plugins area

#### Pinata
Storing data on a chain is expensive. IPFS is a technology that can be used to store and retrieve files from a decentralized system. IPFS distributes each file across multiple nodes in its own network. It breaks down the file into pieces of data and then distributes the pieces across multiple nodes. Smart contracts and dApps can store and retrieve their files directly from the nodes that have the data pieces. This means that they store and access their data by using a decentralized technologyâ€”without the expense of storing that data on the chain.
For this dApp Pinata is utilized for IPFS services. 

1. Go to Pinata website [Pinata Website](https://www.pinata.cloud/)
2. Sign up for a free account.
3. Log into the pinata and proceed to the dashboard. 
4. In the developers section please select API keys or access through the following link [Pinata API Keys](https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys)
5. Please click on + New Key
6. Make sure to click the option to grant Admin privileges for your keys.
7. Please insert a Key Name
8. Click Create Key button
![Pinata_API_Keys](Images/Pinata_API.jpg)
9. Open Sample.env file in the cloned folder and copy the Pinata API KEY and SECRET KEY in the Sample.env file and save Sample.env file. 





Copy the provided SAMPLE.env file to a new file named .env, and then add the missing data to the environment variables.
